- Activate the shortcut by saying "Get Me Jarvis" or click on the shortcut directly.
- Customize the system message to change ChatGPT's behavior.
- In the latest update GetMeJarvis can support the GPT4 API. If you have the GPT 4 API, you can choose the GPT 4 instead of the default GPT 3.5.


Please note that the API has a fee of $0.0020/1K tokens, with 1k tokens equal to approximately 750 words. 
The ChatGPT model supports continuous dialogue and can record context. Say "New chat" to start a new conversation and "Goodbye Jarvis" to exit.

Changing proxy too frequently or using it in countries where OpenAI did not support service or any other abuse or behaviour that violate OpenAI's terms and services MAY RESULT in YOUR ACCOUNT BE BANNED! This has nothing to do with me or this project. Do use it responsibly.
